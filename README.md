# CS354 Student Environment 

This repo contains the scripts to start many of the projects and labs.

### You will need:

1. Windows users need the [linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. Everyone needs Docker [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Many labs/projects will be conducted in docker containers so that each student has identical separate setups. This prevents one person from interfering with another, and version inconsistencies.
